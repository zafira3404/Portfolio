        &ensp; This project was a semester long group project, 
        that had the group reverse-engineer and make 3d models of a product. 
        My product was a honeywell personal tower fan.

    <h2>PRODUCT DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>
        A Tower fan is a technological device to give a more powerful airflow. Tower fans work by having air being propelled forward
        with the blades causing it to spin and push out cool air. These are called impeller blades that move the air through the columns
        and out the vents. This tower fan has a small footprint, meaning it occupies less space. The advantages of having a tower fan
        are the design that lets it fit into small places, the weight that makes it affordable to carry around, and the gentle cooling provided
        to those using it. The only disadvantage of the tower fan might be the noise made while working, but this isnâ€™t something
        intolerable that completely distracts the people around. Many people use this kind of fan daily to have a cool room with fresh air
        offering the best conditions to keep a chill environment where they can do all they need without the sensation of uncomfortably.
        Companies invest a lot of money in this product to give their employees the best atmosphere, which will motivate them to work
        harder, bringing benefits to the company.
